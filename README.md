## 📋 Introduction  

A/B testing is a powerful method for comparing two versions of a web page, app feature, or system to determine which performs better. This project guides you through the entire process, including:  
- Hypothesis formulation  
- Test design  
- Data collection  
- Analysis  
- Interpretation of results  

---

## 🎯 Objective  

The goal of this project is to:  
- Formulate hypotheses for a hypothetical scenario.  
- Design and execute an A/B test to compare two variations.  
- Collect, clean, and analyze data to draw actionable insights.  
- Provide data-driven recommendations based on test results.

## 🚀 Usage  

1. Ensure that the **`Data.txt`** file is placed in the project directory.  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:  

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Week2 Day4 Task1.ipynb"
   ```  

3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to:  
   - Design an A/B test  
   - Collect and clean data  
   - Perform statistical analysis  
   - Interpret results and draw conclusions

## 📈 A/B Test Workflow  

The notebook **`Week2 Day4 Task1.ipynb`** walks you through:  

1. **Formulating Hypotheses**  
   - Define clear null and alternative hypotheses based on a hypothetical scenario.  

2. **Designing the A/B Test**  
   - Select appropriate metrics for comparison.  
   - Determine the test size and duration.  

3. **Collecting and Cleaning Data**  
   - Simulate or use provided data to ensure accuracy and reliability.  

4. **Analyzing Test Results**  
   - Perform statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, chi-squared tests).  
   - Visualize results for better understanding.  

5. **Interpreting Results**  
   - Evaluate whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis.  
   - Provide actionable recommendations.
